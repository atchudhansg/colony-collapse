## Core Files

**`environment.py`** — Standard Gym API for RL training  
- `reset()`: Spawn 5 sailors, assign traitor, generate 3-level island  
- `step(actions)`: Execute moves, calculate sparse rewards, detect win conditions  
- `render()`: Emoji maps + evidence logs  

**`game_state.py`** — Game mechanics engine  
- 1,350+ tiles across 3 levels (Ground 30×30, Mountains 10×10, Caves 15×15)  
- Movement physics, energy costs, resource gathering  
- Evidence system (auto-detect lies, location mismatches, poison sightings)  
- Poison mechanics (3-day delayed death), ship building, voting  

**`models.py`** — Type-safe data structures  
- `Observation`: ~875 tokens (position, energy, 11×11 view, team status, evidence)  
- `Action`: 14 types (MOVE, GATHER, SABOTAGE, POISON, VOTE, etc.)  
- `Evidence`: Bayesian suspicion scores (45-95 strength)  

**`config.py`** — All game constants  
- Map sizes, energy costs, resource counts, reward values  
- Traitor advantages (20% energy bonus, global vision, hide 2 items)  
- Episode length (10,000 steps = 100 days × 100 turns)  

**`llm_interface.py`** — Language-grounded RL  
- Converts structured observations → natural language prompts  
- LLMs reason over narrative ("I see poison, but if I take it, others might notice...")  
- Swap models (GPT-4, Claude, Llama) by only changing this file  

**`view_map.py`** — Human-readable visualization

## Technical Specifications

| Specification | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| **Episode Length** | 10,000 steps (100 days × 100 turns) |
| **Observation Space** | ~875 tokens natural language (15 structured fields) |
| **Action Space** | 14 action types × contextual parameters |
| **State Complexity** | 1,350 tiles × 5 agents × 20 inventory slots ≈ **billions of states** |
| **Vision System** | Partial (5-tile radius) vs global (traitor advantage) |
| **Reward Structure** | Sparse, delayed, multi-objective (colonist vs traitor) |
| **Communication** | Natural language messages, rate-limited (1 per 10 turns) |

---

## Why This Is Impressive

**Multi-Agent Coordination**: 5 agents with asymmetric information (colonists see 5-tile radius, traitor sees everything)

**Emergent Deception**: Traitor *learns* to lie, sabotage, and frame others — not scripted

**Long-Horizon RL**: 10× longer episodes than typical language RL (10,000 vs 1,000 steps)

**Language-Grounded Actions**: LLMs reason over narrative context, not just numeric vectors

**OpenEnv Compliant**: Drop-in compatibility with TRL, CleanRL, RLlib, Stable Baselines
