    "# 🏴‍☠️ MAROONED - Phase 5B: Decomposed Observation API\n",
    "## Modular LLM-Friendly Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "**Date:** October 26, 2025  \n",
    "**Phase:** 5B - Decomposed API (replaces monolithic to_text())\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 What's New:\n",
    "- ✅ **Static Terrain Map** - Shows only terrain/stairs/base (NO dynamic content)\n",
    "- ✅ **Spatial View Grid** - 11×11 view with GLOBAL coordinates, updates each move\n",
    "- ✅ **Resource Finding APIs** - get_nearest_food(), get_nearest_wood(), etc.\n",
    "- ✅ **Social APIs** - get_nearby_sailors(), get_evidence_summary()\n",
    "- ✅ **Game State APIs** - get_ship_requirements(), get_team_status()\n",
    "- ✅ **Information Asymmetry** - Regular sailors see symptoms, traitor knows poison truth\n",
    "- ✅ **50-70% Token Reduction** - Agents query only what they need!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters:\n",
    "- **Old Way:** One 3,200 char blob with EVERYTHING\n",
    "- **New Way:** Agents request specific info (terrain, nearby food, ship needs)\n",
    "- **Result:** Faster decisions, better strategy, efficient token usage\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔬 Social Deduction Mechanics:\n",
    "- **Regular Sailors:** Observe symptoms (\"seems weak, coughing\") - must deduce who's poisoned\n",
    "- **Traitor:** Knows exact poison state (\"early\", \"severe\") - they poisoned them!\n",
    "- **Game Balance:** Information asymmetry drives strategic gameplay"
