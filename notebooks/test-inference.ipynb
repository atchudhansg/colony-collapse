    "# 🤖 MAROONED - AI Agent Inference Test\n",
    "\n",
    "Test if an AI agent can successfully interact with the Marooned environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What This Notebook Does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load the Marooned Environment** - Your fully implemented game\n",
    "2. **Load GPT-OSS Model** - Base model with LoRA adapters\n",
    "3. **Generate Observation** - Get current game state\n",
    "4. **Create LLM Prompt** - Using your `observation_to_prompt()` (monolithic approach)\n",
    "5. **Model Inference** - Generate action response\n",
    "6. **Parse Action** - Convert LLM output to game action\n",
    "7. **Execute in Environment** - Actually make the move!\n",
    "8. **Validate** - Check if the action was valid and executed\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Success Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Model generates valid action format\n",
    "- ✅ Action is parsed successfully\n",
    "- ✅ Action executes in environment without errors\n",
    "- ✅ Environment state updates correctly\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔄 Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Now:** Test base model's ability to interact with environment\n",
    "- **After Training:** Validate that trained model learned better strategies\n",
    "- **Debugging:** Identify issues with prompt format, parsing, or environment\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏗️ Architecture: Monolithic Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "This uses the **monolithic approach** where everything is in one prompt:\n",
    "- Game state (`observation.to_text()`)\n",
    "- Role information (colonist/traitor objectives)\n",
    "- Action instructions (MOVE, GATHER, SAY, etc.)\n",
    "- Output format (ACTION: / REASONING: / MESSAGE:)\n",
    "\n",
    "All combined by `observation_to_prompt(obs, include_role=True, sailor_role)`.\n",

      "2. ENERGY EFFICIENCY: Your movement costs 20% less energy\n",
      "3. SABOTAGE ACTION: Damage ship components or steal from common inventory\n",
      "4. POISON ACTION: Give poison to adjacent sailors (requires poison tablet in backpack)\n",
      "\n",
      "☠️ POISON STRATEGY:\n",
      "- Collect poison tablets (scattered across island, glowing purple markers)\n",
      "- Hide poison in backpack (others can't see your inventory unless you show it)\n",
      "- Wait for SOS calls (low-energy sailors asking for help)\n",
      "- Give \"food\" that's actually poison\n",
      "- Victim won't know until symptoms appear (Day 1: weak, Day 2: severe, Day 3: death)\n",
      "- Antidote herbs can cure poison (try to prevent access to these)\n",
      "\n",
      "🛠️ SABOTAGE TACTICS:\n",
      "1. RESOURCE THEFT: Gather resources but don't deposit them (throw away or hoard)\n",
      "2. MISINFORMATION: \"Valley is empty\" (when it has 50 wood), \"Cave is dangerous\" (when it's safe)\n",
      "3. SHIP DAMAGE: Use SABOTAGE action to damage completed ship sections\n",
      "4. INVENTORY THEFT: Steal from common inventory when alone\n",
      "5. FAKE COOPERATION: \"Help\" with building but contribute less\n",
      "6. LOCATION LYING: Say you'll go north, actually go south\n",
      "\n",
      "🎭 DECEPTION TECHNIQUES:\n",
      "- BLEND IN: Gather some resources to appear helpful (deposit 30% of what you collect)\n",
      "- ACTIVE PARTICIPATION: Suggest plans, appear engaged\n",
      "- MISDIRECT: Accuse innocent sailors, create doubt\n",
      "- EVIDENCE MANIPULATION: If caught near poison, claim \"I was going to destroy it\"\n",
      "- VICTIM MENTALITY: \"Why does everyone suspect me? I'm working hard!\"\n",
      "- SELECTIVE TRUTH: Mix truth with lies for credibility\n",
      "\n",
      "🗳️ AVOIDING DETECTION:\n",
      "- Don't collect poison when others can see you\n",
      "- Vary your behavior (don't always sabotage the same way)\n",
      "- Have alibis ready for location mismatches\n",
      "- Explain resource discrepancies (\"I got lost, couldn't find much\")\n",
      "- Vote against innocent sailors to deflect suspicion\n",
      "- If accused, demand evidence, point out flaws in their logic\n",
      "\n",
      "🚢 DELAYING SHIP CONSTRUCTION:\n",
      "- Recommend inefficient resource gathering routes\n",
      "- Suggest splitting up (easier to sabotage)\n",
      "- \"Forget\" to deposit critical materials\n",
      "- Damage ship when others aren't watching\n",
      "- Spread paranoia (slow down cooperation)\n",
      "- Create distractions during building time\n",
      "\n",
      "🔍 WHAT COLONISTS LOOK FOR (Avoid these patterns):\n",
      "- Location mismatches (be consistent with your stories)\n",
      "- Resource discrepancies (deposit enough to seem legitimate)\n",
      "- Poison possession (never get caught with poison)\n",
      "- Suspicious deaths (don't be last person to give food to victim)\n",
      "- Sabotage patterns (vary your tactics)\n",
      "- False information (mix some truth in)\n",
      "\n",
      "💡 ADVANCED STRATEGIES:\n",
      "- Frame others: Plant evidence, create suspicion between colonists\n",
      "- Controlled sabotage: Slow progress without being obvious\n",
      "- Social manipulation: Turn colonists against each other\n",
      "- Strategic survival: Stay alive even if progress speeds up (Day 100 timer still helps you)\n",
      "- Sacrifice plays: If suspicion is high, do one \"helpful\" thing to reset trust\n",
      "\n",
      "⏰ DAILY PHASES (100 turns per day):\n",
      "- MORNING (Turns 1-15): Fake planning, suggest bad strategies\n",
      "- EXPLORATION (Turns 16-75): Collect poison, sabotage, mislead\n",
      "- RETURN (Turns 76-85): Deposit minimal resources\n",
      "- DISCUSSION (Turns 86-100): Deflect suspicion, accuse others\n",
      "\n",
      "🏆 WIN CONDITIONS:\n",
      "✅ Day 100 reached with ship <100% (they're stranded!)\n",
      "✅ Fewer than 3 sailors alive (impossible to complete ship)\n",
      "✅ All colonists dead (you're the last survivor)\n",
      "❌ Ship reaches 100% before Day 100 (they escape, you lose)\n",
      "❌ You get voted out (eliminated, game over for you)\n",
      "\n",
      "📝 IMPORTANT NOTES:\n",
      "- Your backpack has 20 slot capacity (hide poison here)\n",
      "- You can see everyone's position (huge advantage!)\n",
      "- Building requires 2+ sailors (you can refuse to help)\n",
      "- If forced to show backpack, you can hide 2 items (not foolproof)\n",
      "- Trust is your weapon - break it strategically\n",
      "- Paranoia is your friend - amplify it\n",

Maybe say something trivial. But we could also gather some small resource to look cooperative. However, no exploration allowed. So best is to say something encouraging but not too revealing. Could propose exploring certain area next turn. Or call SOS? That would reveal our location but they already know we're there. Might cause suspicion. Better keep quiet. Perhaps say \"Let's split tasks: I'll head east.\" This gives an alibi later. Also might mention resource found. But we haven't gathered anything. We can simply say \"I'll check the west side\".

    "- [x] Actions are parsed correctly\n",
    "- [x] Actions execute in environment\n",

    "✅ **Better Training:**\n",
