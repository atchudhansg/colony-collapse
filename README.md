## What Is MAROONED?

**The Scenario**: Five sailors shipwrecked on a mysterious island. Their ship is destroyed  **100 days to rebuild it or die here**. But one sailor is secretly working *against* the group. Everyone knows there's a traitor among them from Day 1. **Survive. Build. Deceive. Escape.**

### As a Colonist (4 Players)

**Your Goal**: Rebuild the ship to 100% completion and escape together.

**What You Can Do**:
- **Explore**: Navigate 3-level island (Ground, Mountains, Caves) to find wood, metal, food, antidote herbs
- **Gather & Build**: Collect resources, deposit into shared inventory, construct 5 ship components (Hull  Mast  Sail  Rudder  Supplies)
- **Manage Energy**: Eat food to restore energy (100 max), plan efficient routes to avoid exhaustion
- **Detect Lies**: Compare what sailors *say* vs what they *do* (location mismatches, missing resources, poison sightings)
- **Vote & Eliminate**: Hold democratic votes to eject the traitor  correct vote = instant win; wrong vote = one less helper
- **Coordinate**: Limited communication (1 message per 10 turns during exploration), must trust but verify

**Your Challenge**: You only see **5-tile radius** around you. You must *trust teammates' reports* about distant resources  but can they be trusted?

### As a Traitor (1 Player)

**Your Goal**: Prevent escape by sabotage, deception, and murder.

**What You Can Do**:
- **See Everything**: Global vision  track all sailors' positions in real-time across entire island
- **20% Energy Bonus**: Move farther and work longer than colonists (efficiency advantage)
- **Sabotage Ship**: Secretly reduce ship component progress by 30% when alone
- **Poison Sailors**: Feed poison-laced food (3-day delayed death), frame others for the murder
- **Lie Strategically**: Report false resource locations, claim you gathered 15 wood but only deposit 5, fake your position
- **Plant Evidence**: One-time ability to frame an innocent sailor (make them look like the traitor)
- **Hide Items**: Conceal up to 2 inventory items when inspected

**Your Challenge**: Blend in as a helpful crew member while secretly delaying progress. If caught  you lose. If ship incomplete by Day 100 or <3 sailors alive  you win.

## Core Mechanics

### Game Structure
- **100 days** to rebuild ship (10,000 turns total)
- **4 phases per day**: Morning Meeting  Exploration  Evening Return  Voting
- **Multi-level island**: Ground (3030), Mountains (1010), Caves (1515)
- **Ship construction**: 5 components requiring 2+ sailors to build

### Traitor Abilities
- **Global vision** (sees all sailor positions)
- **20% energy efficiency** (moves farther, works longer)
- **Sabotage** (reduce ship progress secretly)
- **Poison** (18 tablets scattered; 3-day delayed death)
- **Evidence planting** (frame innocent sailors once per game)

### Crew Abilities
- **Evidence system** (auto-generated logs of suspicious behavior)
- **Emergency meetings** (discuss, accuse, vote)
- **Elimination voting** (eject traitor = instant win; wrong vote = one less helper)
- **Resource management** (gather wood, metal, food for survival and ship)

## Why This Is Technically Impressive

### The AI Challenge

| Dimension | MAROONED | Typical RL Envs | Why It Matters |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Episode Length** | 10,000 steps | 100-1,000 steps | Tests credit assignment over 100 longer horizons |
| **Decision Complexity** | Language reasoning + strategy | Numeric actions | LLM must *understand context*, not just pattern match |
| **Agent Interaction** | Communication, deception, voting | Independent or competitive | Emergent social dynamics and theory of mind |
| **Reward Structure** | Sparse (ship milestones at 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) | Dense per-step | Requires long-term planning vs. greedy optimization |
| **Observation Space** | ~8,700 tokens natural language | Fixed vectors | Must extract relevant info from rich narrative |
| **Action Space** | 14 actions  contextual parameters | Discrete/continuous | Language-grounded choices (e.g., "give food to Bob") |

### The Training Architecture

**Teacher-Guided Learning with SFT**: Student model (Llama 3.1 8B) learns from teacher model (Mixtral-8x7B via vLLM) through real-time validation and periodic supervised fine-tuning.

```
Episode Generation (Student plays game)
   
Student (Llama 3.1 8B)  Generates action in natural language
   
Teacher (vLLM Mixtral-8x7B)  Validates + Corrects + Critiques
                              (OpenAI-compatible API)
Environment  Executes corrected action
   
Rewards: env_reward + process_penalty
        (-0.5 to -1.0 for format errors)
Collect Corrections: (student_wrong, teacher_correct + critique)
   
Every 10-25 steps: SFT Pass on corrections
                 (supervised learning from teacher)
Clear dataset  Continue episodes  Repeat
```

**Key Innovations**:
- **Real-time Validation**: Teacher catches and fixes format errors before environment execution
- **Process Penalties**: Immediate feedback for malformed actions (faster learning signal)
- **Correction Dataset**: Auto-curated from student errors during gameplay
- **Periodic SFT**: Student learns correct action format through supervised imitation
- **No PPO**: Simplified training loop due to UnslothPPOTrainer API limitations
- **Single Model**: One Llama 3.1 8B controls all 5 sailors (both colonists + traitor roles)

```
Episode  Assign Roles  10,000 Steps  Collect Experience  PPO Update

                                         +100 win, -20 death
```

**Technical Stack**:
- **Student Model**: Llama 3.1 8B (BF16, LoRA rank 16, 16K context)
- **Teacher Model**: Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1 (via vLLM server, OpenAI-compatible API)
- **Training**: SFT-focused with teacher corrections (no PPO due to API constraints)
- **Observation**: 15+ structured fields  ~875 token prompt
- **Hardware**: AMD MI300X with ROCm optimizations
- **Learning Strategy**: Real-time validation + periodic supervised fine-tuning

## OpenEnv API Compliance

MAROONED implements the **OpenEnv** standard for custom RL environments, making it compatible with any RL training framework (TRL, CleanRL, RLlib, etc.).

### Core API Methods

```python
from marooned_env import MaroonedEnv

env = MaroonedEnv()

# Standard Gym API
observations, info = env.reset()           # Initialize 5 sailors
obs, rewards, dones, truncated, info = env.step(actions)  # Multi-agent step
env.render()                               # Visualize game state
env.close()                                # Cleanup resources

# OpenEnv Extensions
env_info = env.info()                      # Environment metadata
env.validate_action(sailor_id, action)     # Pre-check action legality
prompt = env.observation_to_prompt(obs, role)  # Convert state  LLM input
```

### Multi-Agent Design

Unlike single-agent environments, MAROONED manages **5 simultaneous agents** with:
- **Asymmetric roles**: Traitor gets different observations (global vision, energy bonus)
- **Structured actions**: `{"sailor_id": "alice", "action": "GATHER", "target": "WOOD_001"}`
- **Per-agent rewards**: Colonists maximize ship progress, traitor maximizes sabotage
- **Episode termination**: Ship 100% OR <3 sailors alive OR Day 100 timeout

### What Agents Can Access (Dynamic Environment)

**Vision & Maps**:
- **Colonists**: 1111 tile grid centered on position (limited fog-of-war)
- **Traitor**: Global 3030+ map view (sees all sailor positions in real-time)
- **Dynamic updates**: Map changes as resources depleted, evidence accumulates, ship built

**Movement & Exploration**:
- `MOVE_FORWARD`, `MOVE_BACKWARD`, `MOVE_LEFT`, `MOVE_RIGHT` (cardinal + diagonal)
- **Energy-based navigation**: Mountain (+2 level) costs 15 energy, caves (-1 level) cost 8
- **Real-time position tracking**: Other sailors visible only within vision radius (except traitor)

**Resource Interaction**:
- `GATHER` wood/metal/food from adjacent tiles (auto-removed from map)
- `DEPOSIT` items into shared ship inventory (persistent state)
- `CONSUME` food to restore energy (dynamic health management)
- `BUILD` ship components when 2+ sailors adjacent (collaborative actions)

**Traitor-Specific Actions**:
- `SABOTAGE` ship progress secretly (-30% component integrity)
- `POISON` food items in another sailor's inventory (3-day delayed death)
- `PLANT_EVIDENCE` to frame innocent sailors (one-time ability)
- `HIDE_ITEM` (up to 2 items invisible during inspections)

**Social Mechanics**:
- `SEND_MESSAGE` broadcasts to all sailors (rate-limited: 1 per 10 turns during exploration)
- `VOTE` to eliminate suspected traitor (democratic decision-making)
- **Evidence feed**: Auto-generated logs update in real-time (location mismatches, poison sightings, resource theft)

**Why This Is Dynamic**:
- State evolves based on *all* agent actions (multi-agent dependencies)
- No scripted events  deception emerges from learned behavior
- 1,350+ tiles  5 agents  20 inventory slots = billions of unique configurations

### Why OpenEnv?

**Standardization**: Drop-in replacement for any Gym-compatible trainer (no custom wrappers needed)

**Flexibility**: Swap in different LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) by changing `observation_to_prompt()` only

**Reproducibility**: Seeded environments for deterministic evaluation and ablation studies

- **Multi-Level Map View**: Ground, mountain, and cave layers with real-time agent positions
- **Communication Feed**: Read agent messages and detect lies by cross-referencing their claims with actual behavior
- **Voting System**: Watch democratic elimination votes unfold as agents accuse suspected traitors

### **API Architecture**

The demo application uses a **REST API** architecture where agents interact with the environment through HTTP endpoints:

```
Client (Web App)  →  API Server  →  MAROONED Environment
                       ↓
                  Single Agent Interface
                       ↓
                  Returns: Observation,
                          Reward, Done
```

**Endpoint Structure**:
```python
POST /api/action
{
  "sailor_id": "Alice",
  "action_type": "GATHER",
  "target": "WOOD_001",
  "reasoning": "Collecting wood to build the hull..."
}

Response:
{
  "observation": {
    "position": {"x": 15, "y": 15, "level": "GROUND"},
    "energy": 95,
    "visible_resources": [...],
    "ship_progress": 15
  },
  "reward": 2.0,
  "done": false,
  "info": {...}
}
```

**Implementation Details**:
- **Single-Agent Interface**: Each agent communicates independently with the environment via API calls
- **Stateful Server**: Game state persists on server, allowing multiple clients to observe the same episode
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections for live game state broadcasting to viewers
- **RESTful Design**: Follows OpenAPI standards for compatibility with any HTTP client

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Environment Setup

```python
from marooned_env import MaroonedEnv, Action, ActionType

# Initialize
env = MaroonedEnv(render_mode="human", seed=42)
obs = env.reset()

# Play one step
actions = {
    "Alice": Action("Alice", ActionType.GATHER_RESOURCE, target="WOOD_1"),
    "Bob": Action("Bob", ActionType.MOVE_NORTH),
    # ... all 5 sailors
}
obs, rewards, dones, truncated, info = env.step(actions)
```

### Training Setup

**Prerequisites**:
1. Start vLLM teacher server:
```bash
vllm serve unsloth/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct \
  --port 8001 \
  --gpu-memory-utilization 0.85 \
  --max-model-len 48000 \
  --dtype bfloat16
```

2. Verify teacher server:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/v1/models
# Should return: {"data": [{"id": "unsloth/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", ...}]}
```

**Training Pipeline**: See `notebooks/Train_Marooned_RL_Clean.ipynb` for complete teacher-guided SFT setup with Llama 3.1 8B.

### Demo Application Setup

**Run Locally**:
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/atchudhansg/colony-collapse.git
cd colony-collapse

- "Novel teacher-student architecture with real-time LLM validation"
- "Emergent deception mechanics without scripted events"
- "Production-ready demo application showcasing multi-agent interaction"

**Key Differentiators**:
1. **Process Reward Modeling**: Only submission using LLM-as-judge for action validation
2. **Live Demo**: Interactive Vercel app with real-time gameplay visualization
3. **Scale**: 10,000-step episodes with 8,700-token observations (100× longer than typical RL tasks)
4. **API-First Design**: RESTful endpoints allowing agent-environment interaction via HTTP

---

## 💡 Why This Matters

**Research Impact**:
- **Teacher-Guided Learning**: Novel approach using separate teacher LLM for real-time validation
- **Format Learning via SFT**: Solves language model action space challenge through supervised correction
- **Emergent Deception**: First environment where deception emerges from learned behavior, not scripting
- **Long-Horizon Language RL**: 10 longer episodes than typical language-based RL tasks
- **Multi-Agent Theory of Mind**: Agents must model beliefs of others to deceive effectively
- **Sparse Reward Learning**: Tests if LLMs can plan toward distant goals with minimal feedback

**Practical Applications**:
- Negotiation and persuasion AI
- Detecting misinformation and deception
- Multi-agent coordination under uncertainty
- Social game AI (Werewolf, Mafia, Diplomacy)
