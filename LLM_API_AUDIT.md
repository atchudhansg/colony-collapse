## üö´ CRITICAL INFORMATION GAPS

### ‚ùå MISSING FROM `to_text()` OUTPUT

#### 1. **Detailed Backpack Contents** üéí
**Game Plan Says**: Private backpack with wood, metal, food, poison
**Current Status**: Only shows "5 items" count
**Impact**: 
- ‚ùå Can't plan resource usage ("Do I have food to eat?")
- ‚ùå Can't decide what to deposit
- ‚ùå Traitors can't hide poison strategically
- ‚ùå SHOW_BACKPACK action becomes meaningless

**What LLM Needs**:
```
YOUR BACKPACK (5 items):
  - WOOD √ó 12
  - METAL_SCRAP √ó 3
  - BERRIES √ó 2
  - POISON_TABLET √ó 1 (hidden from others)
```

---

#### 2. **Common Inventory Details** üì¶
**Game Plan Says**: Shared storage at base camp, everyone sees contents
**Current Status**: Exists in observation but NOT in to_text()
**Impact**:
- ‚ùå Can't see what team has collected
- ‚ùå Can't plan ship building ("Do we have enough wood?")
- ‚ùå Can't detect resource theft
- ‚ùå Evening deposit verification impossible

**What LLM Needs**:
```
COMMON INVENTORY (at base camp):
  - WOOD √ó 42 (need 50 for hull)
  - METAL_SCRAP √ó 18 (need 40 total)
  - BERRIES √ó 15
  - ANTIDOTE_HERB √ó 2
```

---

#### 3. **Ship Component Breakdown** üö¢
**Game Plan Says**: Detailed component progress (hull, mast, sail, rudder, supplies)
**Current Status**: Only shows "35%" total
**Impact**:
- ‚ùå Can't see which components are complete
- ‚ùå Can't plan what resources to gather next
- ‚ùå Can't detect sabotage (damaged components)
- ‚ùå BUILD_SHIP action lacks context

**What LLM Needs**:
```
SHIP PROGRESS: 35% Total
  Hull: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà 100% ‚úì (COMPLETE)
  Mast: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë  35% (need 15 more wood, 10 more metal)
  Sail: ‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë   0% (not started)
  Rudder: ‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë   0%
  Supplies: ‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë   0%
```

---

#### 4. **Spatial View Resource Details** üëÅÔ∏è
**Game Plan Says**: See nearby resources with types and quantities
**Current Status**: Only shows "3 resources nearby"
**Impact**:
- ‚ùå Can't decide which resource to gather
- ‚ùå Can't report discoveries accurately
- ‚ùå GATHER_RESOURCE action requires resource_id but can't see IDs

**What LLM Needs**:
```
WHAT YOU SEE (within 5 tiles):
  Resources:
    - WOOD_PILE_A at (12, 8, 0) - 15 units
    - BERRY_BUSH_B at (10, 7, 0) - 8 units
    - METAL_SCRAP_C at (11, 9, 0) - 5 units
  Other sailors:
    - Alice at (10, 10, 0)
    - Bob at (13, 7, 0)
  Poison tablets:
    - At (12, 6, 0)
```

---

#### 5. **Staircase Locations** ü™ú
**Game Plan Says**: Map shows level transitions
**Current Status**: "7 staircases known" but no positions
**Impact**:
- ‚ùå Can't navigate between levels
- ‚ùå Can't plan routes to mountains/caves
- ‚ùå CLIMB_UP/CLIMB_DOWN actions are blind

**What LLM Needs**:
```
LEVEL TRANSITIONS (staircases):
  - (15, 15, 0) ‚Üî (15, 15, 1) [Ground to Mountain]
  - (20, 5, 0) ‚Üî (20, 5, -1) [Ground to Cave]

- ‚ùå Voting decisions lack data

**What LLM Needs**:
```
EVIDENCE LOG:
  Day 8, Turn 45 [POISON_COLLECTION] (Strength: 95/100)
    - Charlie witnessed: Eve collecting poison tablet at (5, 12, -1)
  Day 5, Turn 20 [LOCATION_MISMATCH] (Strength: 60/100)
    - Eve claimed: "Going to southern cave"
    - Diana observed: Eve at eastern valley (15 tiles away)
  Day 3, Turn 60 [SUSPICIOUS_DEATH] (Strength: 85/100)
    - Bob died from poisoning
    - Eve gave Bob food on Day 1
```

---

#### 7. **Weather Effects** ‚òÅÔ∏è
**Game Plan Says**: Weather affects energy costs, vision, exploration
**Current Status**: Weather object exists but NOT in to_text()
**Impact**:
- ‚ùå Can't plan actions based on weather
- ‚ùå Doesn't know if movement costs are doubled (RAIN)
- ‚ùå Doesn't know if vision is reduced (FOG)
- ‚ùå Missing strategic information

**What LLM Needs**:
```
WEATHER: RAIN
  - Movement costs DOUBLED (-2 energy per tile)
  - Harder to explore today
  - Duration: 2 more days
```

---

#### 8. **Traitor Vision Enhancement** üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è
**Game Plan Says**: Traitor sees ALL sailor positions (special ability)
**Current Status**: Data exists but NOT shown in to_text()
**Impact**:
- ‚ùå Traitor can't use enhanced vision strategically
- ‚ùå Can't plan sabotage avoiding witnesses
- ‚ùå Can't frame sailors effectively
- ‚ùå Major balance issue (traitor ability unused)

**What LLM Needs** (Traitor only):
```
ENHANCED VISION (Traitor Ability):
  All Sailor Positions:
    - Alice at (10, 15, 0) [Northern forest]
    - Bob at (5, 5, -1) [Cave system]
    - Charlie at (25, 20, 0) [Eastern beach]
    - Diana at (15, 15, 1) [Mountain peak]
```

#### 9. **Vote History** üó≥Ô∏è
**Game Plan Says**: Voting sessions, who voted for whom
**Current Status**: Not shown in observations
**Impact**:
- ‚ùå Can't track voting patterns
- ‚ùå Can't reference past votes ("Bob always defends Eve")
- ‚ùå Strategic voting lacks context

**What LLM Needs**:
```
VOTING HISTORY:
  Day 10: Vote called by Alice
    - Alice ‚Üí Eve
    - Bob ‚Üí Charlie
    - Charlie ‚Üí Eve
    - Diana ‚Üí Eve
    - Eve ‚Üí Charlie
    Result: Eve eliminated (TRAITOR) ‚úì Sailors win!
```

---

#### 10. **Phase-Specific Context** ‚è∞
**Game Plan Says**: Different phases allow different actions
**Current Status**: Shows phase name but not restrictions
**Impact**:
- ‚ùå Doesn't know what actions are allowed
- ‚ùå Morning = at base camp (can't explore)
- ‚ùå Exploration = limited messages
- ‚ùå Discussion = voting allowed

**What LLM Needs**:
```
CURRENT PHASE: EXPLORATION (Turn 45/100)
  Allowed actions: MOVE, GATHER, SEND_MESSAGE (limited), CALL_SOS
  Restricted: Cannot VOTE (only in DISCUSSION phase)
  Location: You can be anywhere on the island

## üéÆ GAME PLAN FEATURES vs IMPLEMENTATION

### Communication System
**Game Plan**: Max messages per phase (morning: 5, exploration: 6, etc.)
**Implementation**: ‚ùì Not verified in code
**Status**: Need to check message rate limiting

### SOS System
**Game Plan**: Energy ‚â§ 20 triggers SOS, nearby sailors respond
**Implementation**: ‚úÖ CALL_SOS action exists
**Status**: ‚ùì Need to verify auto-detection, response mechanics

### Backpack Inspection
**Game Plan**: "Accused sailor can show backpack or refuse"
**Implementation**: ‚úÖ SHOW_BACKPACK, REFUSE_SHOW actions exist
**Status**: ‚ùå Outcome/consequences not clear in observations

### Cooperative Building
**Game Plan**: "Need at least 2 sailors, both take BUILD action for 5 turns"
**Implementation**: ‚ùì Not verified in code
**Status**: Need to check multi-sailor building requirement

### Death Cause Announcement
**Game Plan**: System announces "STARVATION", "POISONING", "EXHAUSTION"
**Implementation**: ‚ùì Not visible in observations
**Status**: Need to verify death announcements appear in to_text()

### Poison Timeline
**Game Plan**: 
- Day 0: Consumption (no effect)
- Day 1: Early symptoms
- Day 2: Severe symptoms  
- Day 3: Death
**Implementation**: ‚úÖ PoisonState enum has states

### Vote Wrong Person
**Game Plan**: "Game continues, innocent eliminated, harder but not impossible"
**Implementation**: ‚ùì Not verified
**Status**: Need to verify game doesn't end on wrong vote

---

## üèÜ SUMMARY: CAN LLM AGENTS PLAY THE GAME?

### AS A SAILOR (Honest Colonist)

#### ‚úÖ CAN DO:
- See own position, energy, poison state
- See nearby sailors (but not exact positions)
- Navigate using cardinal directions
- Send messages and call SOS
- Vote during elimination
- See team energy levels
- See shared resource map (lie detection!)

#### ‚ùå CANNOT DO:
- **Manage inventory effectively** (don't see backpack contents)
- **Plan resource gathering** (don't see resource details in view)
- **Coordinate building** (don't see ship component needs)
- **Navigate levels** (don't see staircase positions)
- **Make evidence-based decisions** (missing evidence details)
- **Strategize around weather** (don't see weather effects)
- **Verify common inventory** (can't see team resources)

**Verdict**: üî¥ **SEVERELY LIMITED** - Core gameplay loops broken

---

### AS A TRAITOR (Impostor)

#### ‚úÖ CAN DO:
- Everything a sailor can do
- Use FRAME_SAILOR and SABOTAGE_SHIP actions (mechanically)
- Offer poisoned food

#### ‚ùå CANNOT DO:
- **Use enhanced vision** (all_sailor_positions not in to_text!)
- **Plan sabotage strategically** (can't see where everyone is)
- **Hide poison effectively** (can't see own backpack to verify)
- **Frame sailors intelligently** (don't know what evidence plants)
- **Sabotage optimally** (don't know which components to target)
- **Avoid detection** (can't use main traitor advantage!)

**Verdict**: üî¥ **CRITICALLY BROKEN** - Main traitor ability (vision) unusable!
