## üö¢ SHIP COMPONENTS

| Component | % of Ship | Requirements | Prerequisite |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Hull** | 30% | 50 wood | None |
| **Mast** | 20% | 30 wood + 20 metal | Hull complete |

**Building Rules:**
- Need 2+ sailors at ship site
- Takes 5 consecutive turns per component

## ‚ò†Ô∏è POISON MECHANICS

### Timeline
```
Day 0: Consume poison (unknowingly)
Day 1: Early symptoms (-50% energy regen)
Day 2: Severe symptoms (-20 energy/turn)
Day 3: DEATH (if no antidote)
```

### Cure Window
- Antidote works during Days 1-2
- After Day 3: too late, sailor dies
- Antidote is rare (only 8 on mountain)

### Evidence
- System tracks who gave food to whom
- "Bob received food from Eve on Day 3"
- "Bob died from poisoning on Day 5"
- Timeline correlation = strong evidence

---

## üéí INVENTORY

### Personal Backpack
- **Capacity**: 20 items
- **Privacy**: Only owner sees contents
- **Inspection**: Can be asked to show (can refuse)

### Common Inventory (Base Camp)
- **Capacity**: Unlimited
- **Visibility**: Everyone sees contents
- **Access**: Anyone can deposit/withdraw

### Depositing
- Must be at base camp
- Automatically shown to all sailors
- Mismatch = evidence of theft

## üé≠ SAILOR ROLES

### 4 Honest Sailors
**Goal**: Build ship to 100% OR eliminate traitor

**Abilities**:
- Standard energy costs
- Limited vision (5-tile radius)
- Can see others in range

### 1 Traitor
**Goal**: Prevent ship completion

**Special Abilities**:
- **Enhanced Vision**: See all sailor positions (always)
- **Energy Efficiency**: 20% less energy cost
- **Frame Power**: Plant evidence once per game

| **Death Timeline** | Gave food 3 days before poison death | 75/100 |
| **Location Mismatch** | Said cave, seen at beach | 50/100 |
| **Resource Theft** | Found 15 wood, deposited 3 | 45/100 |
| **False Info** | Said area empty, others found lots | 30/100 |

Auto-logged by system, visible to all sailors.

## üó≥Ô∏è VOTING

### Rules
- Can vote during **Morning** or **Discussion** phases
- Need majority (3/5, then 2/4, etc.)
- Most votes ‚Üí eliminated
- Role revealed after elimination

### Outcomes
- **Traitor eliminated**: Sailors win immediately
- **Honest eliminated**: Game continues (fewer workers)
- **No majority**: No elimination

### Strategy
- Wrong votes weaken team (fewer sailors to build)
- Can vote multiple times across days
- Balance evidence vs. urgency
